#
# The CI action in this file is used to build the artifacts on pushes to a repository containing
# the ICU4X service account key. All steps are skipped unless the key is present.
#
# If you are a frequent contributor, you can add the key to your fork. The key is shared with
# icu4x collaborators and can be viewed here:
#
# https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Of-_83MbhiiQAHYL_a5jDotOD9jnbu5c/view
#
# To add the key, follow these steps:
#
# 1. Go to the secrets on your fork:
#     - https://github.com/{USER}/icu4x/settings/secrets/actions
# 2. Click "New repository secret" and enter the following information:
#     - Name: ICU4X_GCP_SA_KEY
#     - Value: The contents of the file linked above
# 3. Click "Add secret"
# 4. Re-run the latest "Artifacts Build" action on your fork to make sure it works:
#     - https://github.com/{USER}/icu4x/actions/workflows/artifacts-build.yml
